# 🛡️ Security Policy for HopeSphere-SmartContracts

## 📌 Reporting a Security Issue
If you discover a security vulnerability in any of the smart contracts, please report it responsibly:

1. **Contact us via email:** [hopesphere@proton.me]
2. **Do NOT open a public issue** on GitHub to report vulnerabilities.
3. **Provide details** of the issue, including:
   - Steps to reproduce.
   - Potential impact on funds, users, or contract integrity.
   - Affected smart contract files and functions.
4. **Acknowledgment and resolution time:**  
   - We aim to acknowledge reports within **48 hours**.  
   - Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed within **7 days**.  
   - High-risk issues will be given priority, with a public disclosure only after a fix is deployed.

## 🛠️ Smart Contract Security Best Practices

### **1. Secure Development Guidelines**
- **Use SafeMath or built-in overflow protection** (Solidity 0.8+ has built-in overflow checks).
- **Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern** to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- **Implement access control** using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` or `AccessControl`.
- **Avoid `tx.origin` for authorization** (use `msg.sender` instead).
- **Use `require()` statements** to validate function inputs.
- **Minimize the use of external contract calls** to reduce attack surfaces.

### **2. Security Testing & Audits**
- **All contracts must undergo automated security tests** before deployment.
- **Run static analysis tools** like `slither` to detect vulnerabilities.
- **Perform fuzz testing** to identify unexpected edge cases.
- **Conduct external security audits** before deploying on the mainnet.

### **3. Deployment & Upgrade Policy**
- **Use a multisig wallet for contract ownership** (e.g., Gnosis Safe).
- **Avoid upgradable contracts unless necessary** (use Proxy patterns carefully).
- **Limit contract self-destruct capabilities** to avoid accidental fund loss.
- **Set up a timelock mechanism** for governance decisions (if applicable).

## 🔄 Incident Response Plan
- **If a vulnerability is exploited:**
  - Immediately pause affected contracts (if possible).
  - Notify affected users and stakeholders.
  - Deploy a fix and audit the solution before redeployment.

- **Post-mortem analysis:**  
  - Document the issue, impact, and resolution process.
  - Share security updates and improvements in public reports.

🔒 Security Policy for Smart Contracts
📌 Reporting a Security Vulnerability
If you find a security vulnerability in our smart contracts, please report it responsibly:

Contact us at security@hopesphere.org
Do NOT create a public issue with vulnerability details.
Provide detailed information, including:
The affected smart contract name and function.
Steps to reproduce the issue.
Potential impact and risk level.
Response Time: We aim to acknowledge security reports within 48 hours and provide a resolution within 7 days.

🛡️ Smart Contract Security Guidelines
Use SafeMath (if applicable): Avoid integer overflow/underflow by using libraries like SafeMath (for Solidity <0.8).
Access Control & Permissions: Ensure that only authorized addresses can execute critical functions.
Reentrancy Protection: Implement checks (e.g., ReentrancyGuard) to prevent reentrancy attacks.
Gas Optimization: Avoid unnecessary loops and high gas-consuming operations.
Events & Logging: Use events to track important transactions and contract state changes.

🔗 Blockchain Security Standards
Contracts should be audited before deployment (internal + external audit).
Use multi-signature wallets for critical administrative functions.
Verify contract source code on block explorers like Etherscan or BscScan.
Follow best practices for interacting with external contracts and oracles.

🚨 Emergency Response Plan
Immediate pause mechanism: Implement a circuit breaker (pause/unpause) for emergency contract suspension.
Incident review process: After an incident, conduct a root cause analysis and document findings.
Bug Bounty Program: Encourage ethical hackers to report issues by offering rewards.
